Each line in the data file represents a returned page of the request launched by the user. 

Each line contains 15 columns. The meaning of each column is as fololows:

column 1: The id of returned page for the current request, which ranges from 0 to 11.  Note that for each page, we return 50 items to the user.
column 2: The hour when the request is launched by the user.

column 3-11: The item-sepcific features/labels. We concat the values of 50 returned items belonging to a request toghether to form a list and separat them by comma.  
More specifically, 
column 3: The concatenated list of **position** for each item in the returned list, which ranges from 0 to 49.
column 4-6: The concatenated list of **predicted ctr/cvr/price** for each item in the returned list.
column 7-10: The concatednated list of **isclcik/iscart/isfav/ispurchase** for each item in the return list to indicate whether the item is cliked/added to cart/added to whishlist/purchased by the user.
column 11: The concatednated list of **an optinal powerful feature** of the item which can be used as one dimension of the "state" vector in RL.

column 12: To indicate whether the current page is the last page browsed by the user. 
column 13-15: The features used to profile the user which includes age-level, gender and the level of purchase power.

So column 1-6,11,13-15 can be used to generate **state** in the paper. Column 7-10 can be used to calclulate the **reward** in the paper. Column 12 represents the **terminal** indicator of RL in the paper.
